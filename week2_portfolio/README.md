## 🎯 Objectives
This project was built to demonstrate:
- Navigation between multiple screens in Flutter
- Use of `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`
- State management using `setState()`
- Passing data between screens
- Clean UI structure using Material Design components
- Proper project organization and GitHub usage

1. **Home Screen**
   - Entry point of the application
   - Provides navigation options to other screens

2. **Departments Screen**
   - Displays a list of university departments
